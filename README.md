# Battery Health Monitoring & Lifecycle Analysis - SQL Queries

## Overview

This repository contains SQL queries designed to track battery health, performance, and lifecycle changes. The queries help monitor key battery health indicators such as state of health (SoH), usage trends, and stock location.

These queries are structured for scalability, performance optimization, and seamless integration with BI tools such as Power BI, Tableau, Mode Analytics, and Looker.

## Queries Included

## Battery Flight History & Health Trends
Objective: Track cumulative battery usage metrics and state of health (SoH) over time.

### Key Metrics:
* Total Flight Distance & Duration (km, hours).
* State of Health (SoH) over time (with missing values filled).
* Estimated Battery Capacity (Ah).

Use Case: Understanding battery performance degradation trends and predicting maintenance needs.

## Battery Health Status & Label Classification
Objective: Assign battery health labels based on SoH and identify significant changes over time.

### Key Metrics:
* Current & Previous SoH Values & Labels.
* Days Since Last Estimate Received.
* Battery Stock Location (Service, Depot, Reserved).

Use Case: Proactive battery maintenance and failure prevention.

## Conclusion
These queries provide critical insights into battery health and lifecycle tracking, helping teams:
* Monitor degradation trends over time.
* Predict battery failures using health classification.
* Optimize battery rotation & replacements.
* Ensure proactive maintenance based on SoH trends.

## Future Enhancements:
* Predictive modeling for battery failure forecasting.
* Geospatial tracking for battery movement analysis.
